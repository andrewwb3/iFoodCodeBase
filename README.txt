model.py contains a short python script that replications the procedure we used to
build and train our final ResNet 152 model. It is adapted from the Jupyter Notebook
and Kaggle Kernel we used to train the model. Note that directories in the file are
the ones that we used and would need to be adjusted if run in a different environment.
